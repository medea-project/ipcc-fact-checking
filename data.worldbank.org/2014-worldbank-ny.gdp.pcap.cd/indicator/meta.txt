Description:
GDP per capita is gross domestic product
divided by midyear population.

GDP is the sum of gross value added
by all resident producers in the economy
plus any product taxes
and minus any subsidies not included in the value of the products.

It is calculated without making deductions
for depreciation of fabricated assets
or for depletion and degradation of natural resources.

Data are in current U.S. dollars.
